Introduction:

Delhivery, India's leading and rapidly growing integrated player, has set its sights on creating
the commerce operating system.
They achieve this by utilizing world-class infrastructure, ensuring the highest quality in
logistics operations, and harnessing cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.


Why this case study?

From Delhivery’s Perspective:

● Delhivery aims to establish itself as the premier player in the logistics industry. This
case study is of paramount importance as it aligns with the company's core objectives
and operational excellence.
● It provides a practical framework for understanding and processing data, which is
integral to their operations. By leveraging data engineering pipelines and data analysis
techniques, Delhivery can achieve several critical goals.
● First, it allows them to ensure data integrity and quality by addressing missing values
and structuring the dataset appropriately.
● Second, it enables the extraction of valuable features from raw data, which can be
utilized for building accurate forecasting models.
● Moreover, it facilitates the identification of patterns, insights, and actionable
recommendations crucial for optimizing their logistics operations.
● By conducting hypothesis testing and outlier detection, Delhivery can refine their
processes and further enhance the quality of service they provide.

From Learners' Perspective:

● Learners will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and cleaning, which is
often the most time-consuming aspect of data analysis.
● Feature engineering is a critical step in building machine learning models. In this case
study, learners will understand how to extract meaningful features from raw data,
including datetime manipulation and column splitting.
● The case study introduces learners to the concept of grouping data based on specific
keys and then aggregating it. This is a key aspect of data analysis, especially when
dealing with time-series data or data with a hierarchical structure.
● Learners will perform hypothesis testing, to validate assumptions and draw insights
from data.
● The case study goes beyond data analysis by focusing on deriving actionable insights
for a business. Learners will understand how data analysis can drive informed
decision-making and recommendations.
